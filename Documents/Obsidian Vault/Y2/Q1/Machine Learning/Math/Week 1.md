## Introduction to probability
### Sample space
- Set of all outcomes S
### Counting
- Compute all possible outcomes
- Probability = size E (success events) / size S (sample space)
#### Tree (alternative)
## Introduction to conditional probability 
### Conditional probability
- P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B) 
- All possible outcomes of A within B's space
## Bayes' theorem - the simplest case
- P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / P(B)
- 2 times conditional probability applied since P(A | B) and P(B | A) both have P(A and B)
