## Classifier evaluation

- h: how spread the probability based on distances
- Bottom left: too spikey and too narrow contours => overfitting 
	- Small h
- Bottom right: overtly smooth lines => underfitting
	- Large h
- Top: optimal classification: important features captured and moderate distance between contours
	- Medium h
### Evaluation methods
- Use cases: high dimensional data that we can't visualize or hyperparameters (fixed parameters such as h in Parzen)
	- These hyperparameters must be decided before seeing the training set, otherwise, cheating
#### Train vs test set

##### Splitting sets
![[Screenshot 2025-07-06 131429.png]]![[Screenshot 2025-07-06 131452.png]]
- Test each training set of size k, calculate average error rate
![[Screenshot 2025-07-06 131731.png]]
- For every data point, train model on rest of data points, test singular point
![[Screenshot 2025-07-06 132331.png]]
- For every dataset, consider it a test set, loop over all other datasets, consider them training sets and compute the error with the h of the training set for the test set

##### Bias-variance trade-off
- Complex models: high variance, low bias but require more data
- Simple models: low variance, high bias and very little data required

*Learning goals*
- Explain the difference between parametric and non-parametric density estimation  
- Explain Parzen, k-Nearest Neighbour and Na√Øve Bayes density estimation and classification in detail.

- Fix size of kernel (sigma^2 = ?)
- On every datapoint, place a kernel function
