## Bounded contexts
### Songs
- Songs may have their own video's and lyrics. 
- Announcements about the release can be made.
- Song radios connect songs that are similar to each other.
- For newly released songs, it is to be decided how is money earned/shared among creators.
### Users
- Users interact with libraries of content that are part of other boundary contexts: playlists, albums, eps and singles by creating their own ones and (dis)liking and commenting on them.
- Each user, can have it's own account settings and a premium or free subscription.
- Users can be connected to other users through a family account through the shared billing or friends which they can have blended playlists with.
### Podcasts
- For newly released podcasts, it is to be decided how is money earned/shared among creators.
- Users interact with podcasts by listening to them.
### Advertisements
- Advertisements are connected to the organisations that make them. By playing adds in between songs, artists get paid.
### APCs
- APCs consist of artists, producers and composers.
- Users from spotify interact with these APCs by listening to them.
- Each APC can have it's own account settings (different from user)
### Playlists
- A creator of a spotify playlist can be spotify, APCs or user's themselves.
- Playlists by spotify can be created by their staff, dedicated to a user or multiple users aka a blend.

From the text I decided on the most important contexts and then identified properties that are unique to that one boundary context.
### Alternatives
1) A separate boundary context for content restrictions. In my opinion, this is a property that can be part of all content types or an overarching boundary context since everything is related to it, but it is not that important it MUST be a separate boundary context.
2) You could make song radios part of playlists instead of songs. Since they are a mix of songs, the way people behave with song radios is also very similar to playlists.
### Core, Generic or Support
- Songs are definitely a core domain as it is the main entity which the platform and all other boundary contexts are built around.
- Users are also a core domain since they are also the main focus of the system where many other boundary contexts depend on.
- Podcasts are also a core domain since, for the same reason as songs, they are also a main functionality of the platform.
- Advertisements are a supporting domain since they are not critical to the main functionality that the platform provides the user.
- APCs are a generic domain since they are critical to songs but not part of the main functionality of listening to content
- Playlists are a supporting domain as well since they are not essential to the functionality of listening to content, but an additional technical feature.
