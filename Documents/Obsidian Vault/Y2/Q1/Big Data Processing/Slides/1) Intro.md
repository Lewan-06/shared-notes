**Intro to Big Data Processing**

### ETL cycle:
-> extract - convert raw/semi structured data into structured data
-> transform - cleanup, join data sources, etc
-> load - load into another system for further processing

  
### Processing types
- Batch processing - all data exists in some source, a program processes the entire dataset at once
- Stream processing - processing of data as they arrive to the system

### Desired properties:
- Robustness and fault-tolerance
- Low latency reads and updates
- Scalability
- Generalisation
- Extensibility
- Ad hoc queries
- Minimal maintenance
- Debuggability
