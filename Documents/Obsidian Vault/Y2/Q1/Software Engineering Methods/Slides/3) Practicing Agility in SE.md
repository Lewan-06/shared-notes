## Agile manifesto
1) Early and continuous delivery 
2) Changing requirements 
3) Tight loop between business people and developers
4) Face-to-face conversations
5) Focus on working software
6) ... (too many to memorise)
### Why agile approach for VUCA?
- Agile = iterative and incremental development 
- VUCA = Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity
### Frameworks

| Name                     | Key characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scrum                    | 1) Fixed length sprints with individual sprint backlog<br>2) Roles: scrum master ensures adherence to scrum practices, product owner maximizes product value, developers develop<br>3) End sprint: check "increment" with stakeholders, new sprint to further increment/improve or next<br>4) Daily scrum meetings |
| Kanban                   | 1) Instead of sprints, use a board of tasks to track their stages and limit work in progress ("visualization")<br>2) Continuous delivery instead of end of sprint                                                                                                                                                  |
| Scrumban                 | Combination above:<br>1) Sprints for review and coordination<br>2) Task board with stages => adjusting backlog continuously and and unfinished work can be added to backlog for later (instead of to this sprint)<br>3) Daily scrum meetings                                                                       |
| XP (eXtreme Programming) | Core principles: planning game, short releases, pair-programming, 40-hour workweeks<br>1) Tight planning/feedback loops:<br>- Pair programming: seconds<br>- Unit tests: minutes<br>- Pair negotiation: hours<br>...<br>- Release plan: months                                                                     |
| Obeya                    | 1) Physical/virtual room to structure discussions around 6 key areas: vision, customer, product, plan, performance, improvement<br>2) Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles                                                                                                                                                     |

### Challenges in large scale agile
1) Team interdependencies => refactoring
2) Unclear line of decision making from strategy to execution
3) Long feedback loops, i.e. low frequency delivery
4) Coping with inefficiencies instead of fixing
5) Management oversimplifying implementation: real implementation requires constant improvement
6) Understanding required behaviour shift
